Landing page for a fictional candy warehouse company using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with an accompanied article published on my blog (WordPress) and marketing graphics by Canva and MailChimp. 

I worked on this locally between November 2023 and March 2024, meaning I did not post the completed project here on GitHub until later.
